# Slick2d-game-notitle
An attempt to make a Slick2d - LWJGL based java game. Work in progress


A Work in progress.

Update v001 - early map & self-made graphics, hud, icons. playing with code. 0 optimalizion done. - (works ONLY on 1920/1080 res, win64 with 64bit java?).

Update v002 - fixed map rendering near edges (no background visible when going to edges), example item & item dropping after mob death, fixed RESOLUTION (works on any res now with 64bit java on win64, best tho is 16:9).

Update v003 - added levels & statistics & several enemies, save/load game (to text file, so editable), revamped fighting and calculations (it's turn based with hit ratio, defense & damage & attack, luck factors, etc), fixed right/bottom side map scrolling.
Tip : while creating character you need atleast 4 chars long name and to add ALL 10 free points. 
Tip2 : Mob tiering : Bee, Spider, Turtle, Lizard, Snake, Boar, Wolf. If encountered a very strong mob instead of Fight (F) you can Escape (E).
